## Statistical mechanics models for cell differentiation

Precise modeling of cell differentiation based on single-cell RNA sequencing is a delicate matter. We invite you to our next webinar on this topic, during which we will review the theoretical background and concepts of statistical mechanics in single-cell biology. In the second part, we will show a tutorial on modeling the differentiation potency of cells using R.
We will be touching the top-down methods (Waddington-OT, PBA, etc.), bottom-up methods (SCENT, SLICE, etc.), and hybrid methods (scEpath, CytoTRACE) of the cell differentiation modeling.
